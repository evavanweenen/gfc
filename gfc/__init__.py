    Functions specific to the TGAS dataset
gfc.pdf
    Functions for dealing with probability density functions (PDFs)
gfc.matrix
    Functions for dealing with A,R,Q,S etc matrices (as defined in Bovy et al. 2009)
gfc.io
    Functions for input and output, to file and to screen
gfc.mapping
    Functions for mapping other functions over large datasets, using multiprocessing and numpy magic where possible
